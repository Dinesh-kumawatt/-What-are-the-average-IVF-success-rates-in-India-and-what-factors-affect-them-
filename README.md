# -What-are-the-average-IVF-success-rates-in-India-and-what-factors-affect-them-

IVF success rates in India depend on a few thingsâ€”like your age, the clinicâ€™s lab quality, the type of infertility, and even lifestyle. On average, if a woman is under 35, success rates can be 50â€“60% per IVF cycle. For women above 35, it may go down to 35â€“45%, and for women above 40, itâ€™s around 15â€“25%. Thatâ€™s just average thoughâ€”it varies case by case.

Now, letâ€™s talk about what really affects IVF success:

Age: Younger eggs = better quality. Itâ€™s just how biology works.

Egg & Sperm Health: Low AMH, low count, or poor motility can lower success.

Embryo Quality: Some clinics grow embryos to day 5 (blastocyst) for better selection.

Endometrium: A good uterine lining is needed for the embryo to stick.

Doctorâ€™s Experience: This honestly matters more than people think.

Some advanced clinics, like Trinity IVF in Ahmedabad, use tools like embryo freezing, PGT testing, and laser hatching, which help improve chances. But no clinic can promise 100%â€”because biology doesnâ€™t always follow rules.

Couples should focus on cumulative success (over 2â€“3 cycles), not just one try. And yes, stress, diet, and even sleep play a role. Itâ€™s all connected.
